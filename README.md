## Installation Instructions:

### Step 1: Install Python
If you haven't already, you need to install Python on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
Choose an IDE to work with Python. Some popular options include:

- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)

Download and install your preferred IDE on your system.

### Step 3: Install Git (Optional but Recommended)
If you want to clone the project directly from GitHub, you need to install Git. You can download Git from the official website: [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Step 4: Clone Your Project Repository (Optional)
If you prefer to work with the project locally, you can clone the project repository to your machine using Git. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tanay-Dwivedi/English-pip-Package.git
```

### Step 5: Navigate to the Project Directory
Open your IDE and navigate to the directory where your project is located.

### Step 6: Install Your Package Dependencies
To install the required dependencies for your package to run, open a terminal or command prompt within your IDE and navigate to the project directory. Then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install all the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file, ensuring your package can function properly.

### Step 7: Use Your Package
You can now use your package in your Python scripts. Import it using:

```python
import enalsis
```

Then, you can call the functions provided by your package as needed.

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure that your package's dependencies are listed in a `requirements.txt` file or clearly documented in your project's README.
- Refer to your package's documentation for detailed usage instructions and examples.
- Provide a link to your package's GitHub repository or any other relevant resources for further exploration and support.
